# Competitive Programming Journey

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into the world of competitive programming. My goal is to sharpen problem-solving skills, improve coding efficiency, and tackle a variety of challenging algorithms and data structures.

## Why Competitive Programming?

Competitive programming is not only about solving problems but also about thinking creatively and logically. This journey will help me:
- Improve my algorithmic skills.
- Build a solid foundation in data structures.
- Prepare for coding interviews and technical challenges.

## Goals and Progress

- **Daily Practice**: Commit to solving at least one problem each day.
- **Learning New Concepts**: Dive into new algorithms and data structures weekly.
- **Competitions**: Participate in online contests to gauge progress and compete with peers.

## Resources

I'm using a variety of resources to enhance my learning:
- **Online Judges**: Platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and CodeChef for hands-on practice.
- **Books and Tutorials**: Reading and following tutorials on topics I'm unfamiliar with.

## Follow My Progress

I'll be updating this repository with solved problems, notes on new algorithms, and other learning milestones.

Letâ€™s solve problems and learn something new every day! ðŸš€
